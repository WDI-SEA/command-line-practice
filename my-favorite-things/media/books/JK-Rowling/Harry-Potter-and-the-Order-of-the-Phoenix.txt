Harry Potter beings another year at Hogwarts, already in trouble for using magic outside school grounds.  Harry seeks aid and council from Dumbledore, only to be ignored.  This leaves Harry feeling lost and alone.  During the school year Harry must also deal with being ostracized once again, this time for his bold claims that Voldemort is back from the dead.  Their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher doesn't believe in practical training as she, along with many others, believe that Voldemort is not back and there is nothing to fear.  He forms and underground resistance group that train themselves in defense techniques to prepare themselves for the coming battle with Voldemort.

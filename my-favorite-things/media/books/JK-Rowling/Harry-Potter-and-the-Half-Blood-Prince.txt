Harry Potter begins a new year at Hogwarts and enrolls in a potions class.  The book he ends up using for the class is an old, tattered book used by a previous student who calls himself, The Half-Blood Prince.  Over the course of the yaer, Harry discovers that the Half-Blood Prince is actual one of his professors, Snape, and that Snape knew his mother and father when they were younger.  Harry also, at the request of Dumbledore, begins a quest to find and destroy the horcruxes that Voldemort has left hidden.  Doing so will kill Voldemort once and for all.

Fargo Rock City: A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural Nörth Daköta is a book written by Chuck Klosterman, first published by Scribner in 2001.[1] It is a history of heavy metal music, with a particular emphasis on the glam metal that flourished during Klosterman's formative years in the mid-to-late 1980s, through its demise in the early 1990s, and potential rebirth in the late 1990s.

Along with analysis and comment, the book is interspersed with Klosterman's memories of growing up as a heavy metal fan in Wyndmere, North Dakota, and later experiences at the University of North Dakota and in Akron, Ohio. These auto-biographical segments are the main storyline. The subtitle of the book employs metal umlauts over the o's in "North Dakota". Such marks have been used decoratively in the names of many heavy metal bands, such as Mötley Crüe and Motörhead, both of whom are discussed in the book.

The title is a reference to Detroit Rock City.

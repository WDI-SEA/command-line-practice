During the beginning of a particularly perilous storm in Derry, Maine six-year-old George "Georgie" Denbrough is chasing a boat made from a sheet of newspaper down a gutter. The boat is washed down a storm drain to the dismay of George, who had received the boat as a present from his older brother Bill. After peering into the drain, George sees a pair of glowing orange eyes which he first believes to be a cat trapped in the sewers. Startled, George watches in confusion as he is suddenly confronted by a man dressed in a silver clown suit with tufts of red hair and orange pom poms who introduces himself as "Mr. Bob Gray" aka "Pennywise the dancing clown". Pennywise offers George a balloon which he cautiously refuses, however the clown entices George to reach into the drain to retrieve his boat and then rips his arm off, leaving the boy in the gutter to bleed to death. Many neighbors on the block immediately hear George's screams and rush to find the boy dead.
